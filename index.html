    	<p><a>What is the Buzz App Game?</a><br />
        You will operate a wooden rod with a hoop through the entire wire.<br />
        Please do not touch the wire as you can, or it will sizzle!<br />
        It is very difficult since you will challenge some of the most popular apps!<br />
        Be careful, they are very attractive, and it is easy to be caught by their stickness!<br />
        Now is the time to show your patience and determination!</p>

    	<p><a>Gift Bonus</a><br />
        No matter which step you take, as long as you experience this game, you will get a gift.<br />
        Feel free to choose a pencil or a clip with various app logos.<br />
        Next time you feel bored and want to use an app for fun, you may think of this gift,<br />
        and think that you still have a lot of important things to do at that moment,<br />
        like read, write, and yes, your works.<br /></p>

    	<p><a>Why?</a><br />
        Social media is constantly increasing its user stickiness.<br />
        Then more people are easy to use these apps when they are bored.<br />
        Some scientists believe that when the brain forms a fixed pattern of using social media<br />once people feel bored, the ability to focus on doing things will get worse.<br />
        So, I made the game. It based on a tradition physical game "buzz wire game".<br />
        I bent wires into some social media logos. The experiencers must resist the "stickiness" <br />from social media while doing the game carefully.
        <br />
        I hope this game can awaken focused feelings, and the experiencers<br />can get some reflective ideas,or they can be happy to challenge the game. <br /></p>

    	<p><a>Save Time</a><br />
        This game does not want to emphasize the win and achievements.<br />
        But experiencers can get rewards. I printed some popular social media logos, added<br />a layer of protection to them with a glue gun, and attached them to  pencils and clips.<br />
        Since scientists believe that frequent use of social media apps will cause<br />crystallized models in the brain,I hope that these gifts can also bring the same effect.<br />
        For example, if you get a pencil with an Instagram logo, then the next time<br />you feel bored and want to play Instagram on your phone, you will also think of this pencil and think about whether you need to write or read something at that time.<br />
        I hope these can help you to save the time to make more progress on your goals.
